# GymManager
Winform Application Created for client that needed a simple gym application for attending
Using C# - Crystal Reports - SQLite database

#How it works
The main app feature is attendance using barcode - the app generates barcode for each member of the gym depending on unique ID 

The application calculates member supscriptions using 2 methods:
1- number of training sessions.

2- monthly supscrition

using the barcode it can track how much time they have left in that supscription - number of sessions remaining and alerts the 
owner of that

it also can work if the gym member forgot his barcode card
